Setting up the object interaction.

Attach the desired script to the object, attaching the text mesh pro object in your scene.
When creating new script for further functionality, set the monobehaviour to 'Interactable' like public class Door_Interaction : Interactable.
This grabs from Interactable script in the scripts folder.
